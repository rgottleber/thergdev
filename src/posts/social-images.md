This one is going to be short.

I followed [a blog post from Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/auto-generate-social-image/) about creating social sharing images. I've implemented it with a TINY amount of code. It's amazing and super slick. Thanks Jason!

His tutorial was super simple and the result is fantastic. I did spend a while getting the vapor wave look and feel right. It was worth it..at least to me.

Huzzah for great looking automation.
