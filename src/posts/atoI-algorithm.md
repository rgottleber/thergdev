Whiteboard interviews. Love them or hate them, they are part of the hiring process these days. There is a sense of change in the air as the practice is starting to fall more out of favor. [Poteto][1] has an ever-growing list of companies that donâ€™t use this practice. Many of these companies use take home projects which, in their own right, are problematic.

_Interviewing is hard, from both sides._

 Back to whiteboards. Defining novel functions may be a part of coding, doing so under pressure and with strange constraints isnâ€™t normal. 

One of the best ways to keep this skill ready is to practice regularly. Iâ€™m working on that part.

Past me was averse to spending too much time on algorithm and data structure practice. Iâ€™ve realized itâ€™s a great way to start learning a new language.

## Enter TypeScript

In my quest to become more fluent in TypeScript Iâ€™ve decided to pick it up via [leetcode][2]

## The Good Stuff

[8. String to Integer (atoi)][3]

> The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:
> 1. Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
> 2. Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
> 3. Read in next the characters until the next non-digit charcter or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
> 4. Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -\> 123, "0032" -\> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
> 5. If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
> 6. Return the integer as the final result.

Here is my go at this. 
```ts
function myAtoi(s: string): number {
  let result = 0;
  let isNegative = 1;
  let i = 0;
  let oneSign = false;

  // check for whitespace and ignore
  while (i < s.length) {
    if (s[i] === " ") {
      i++;
      continue;
    }
    break;
  }
  // check for negative
  if (s[i] === "-") {
    isNegative = -1;
    oneSign = true;
    i++;
  }
  // check for positive
  if (s[i] === "+") {
    if (oneSign) return result;
    i++;
  }
  //loop through rest
  for (; i < s.length; i++) {
    // check if number
    // if non number ignore the rest using unicode
    if (s[i].charCodeAt(0) < 48 || s[i].charCodeAt(0) > 57) break;
    // increment place value
    result *= 10;
    // nifty trick to subtract unicode value
    result += s[i].charCodeAt(0) - 48;
  }
  result *= isNegative;
  return (result > 2147483647)
    ? 2147483647
    : (result < -2147483648)
    ? -2147483648
    : result;
}
```

The part I found most interesting was a nifty trick to use unicode characters to determine the value.

```ts
for (; i < s.length; i++) {
    // check if number
    // if non number ignore the rest using unicode
    if (s[i].charCodeAt(0) < 48 || s[i].charCodeAt(0) > 57) break;
    // increment place value
    result *= 10;
    // nifty trick to subtract unicode value
    result += s[i].charCodeAt(0) - 48;
  }

```

This brings up an interesting point. In a whiteboard session would this be expected? Knowing the unicode values of characters off hand?ðŸ¤”
