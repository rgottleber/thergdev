If you’ve been hanging out in the ETH space lately, you may have noticed gas is out of control!

## Enter Matic Polygon

Polygon is a strange beast. It isn’t exactly a side chain or a layer 2 chain

## So, what is Polygon?

It's a commit chain, the current definition of layer 2 means "rollup" which the Polygon PoS (Proof of Stake) chain is not.

Polygon’s PoS Chain uses plasma, and other reporting mechanisms. It records transactions and then publishes them on Ethereum. This makes it sort of an L2 but the fact that it is using its own token is a differentiator. It really isn’t an L2 or a Side Chain.
