Deploy a [Sapper][1] site every day! This isnâ€™t a post to motivate you to build more sites. Iâ€™ll be working on convincing our future robotic overlords to build the site for me.

At the current time Iâ€™m only using around 10% of my total free [Netlify][2] free tier of build minutes. The free tier is exceptional, especially for the price. There is one feature that I canâ€™t seem to find, scheduled builds.

I want to deploy daily, and why not do it without impacting my build minutes?

## GitHub Actions to the rescue!

Github actions can be configured to run on a schedule using the unix crontab format. [crontab guru][3] can be invaluable if you want to double-check your settings. I am, however, getting ahead of myself. Netlify currently deploys this site on every push. Iâ€™d like to move everything over to GitHub so step one.

### Turn off Netlify Builds

You can find this under `appname -> Site settings -> Build & deploy -> Stop Builds`

Great, everything is broken, just the way we want it. Now itâ€™s time to drop a new file in our project to let GitHub do the heavy lifting.

### Set up the secrets ðŸ¤«

A couple of secrets need to be created in the app.
`NETLIFY_SITE_ID` This is the `API ID` found in `App -> Settings -> General`
`NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` This must be generated. `User Settings -> Applications -> Personal Access Tokens -> New Access Token`
**Note: This is an access token to your account. Treat it like a password!**

These two values will need to be saved in GitHub.

There are two ways to save them on GitHub.

`Repo -> Settings -> Secrets -> New Repository Secret` and create them both here.

Or via the `gh` cli tool
`gh secret set NETLIFY_SITE_ID -b"id from api id"`
`gh secret set NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN -b"id from access token"`

### Setup GitHub actions

Save the secrets and create a yaml to inform the GitHub action.

`.github/workflows/deploy-on-push.yaml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to Netlify on commits to master
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout repo
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run export

      # Deploy the site with netlify-cli
      - name: Deploy Site
        env:
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        run: netlify deploy --dir="__sapper__/export" --prod
```

Again, this example is for sapper. If you were building something different this would work just change

`npm run export`

and

`netlify deploy --dir="__sapper__/export" --prod`

To the proper values.

### Scheduled deploys

Almost done, one last thing is to set up scheduled deploys to build the site when we want it to actually deploy.
Add the `schedule:` bit

`.github/workflows/deploy-on-push.yaml`

```yaml
name: Deploy to Netlify on commits to master
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  ######
  # This is the new stuff
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 13 * * *" # every day at 8CDT
  ######
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout repo
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build site
        run: npm run export

      # Deploy the site with netlify-cli
      - name: Deploy Site
        env:
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
        run: netlify deploy --dir="__sapper__/export" --prod
```

Just like that the site will deploy on its own!
